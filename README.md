#Data Structures Projects

Welcome to the Data Structures Projects repository! This collection of projects showcases my work in implementing 
various data structures and their associated methods. Within this repository, you will find projects related to 
rational numbers, duration class for time management, vector library implementation, double-linked list, 
sentinel-based double-linked list, stack and queue implementations, as well as heap and map implementations.

#Rational Numbers

The Rational Numbers project focuses on representing and manipulating rational numbers. I have implemented 
a Rational class that provides methods for performing arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division on rational numbers. Additionally, the class includes functionality for simplifying 
and comparing rational numbers.

#Duration Class

The Duration Class project revolves around managing time durations. The implemented Duration 
class enables operations such as addition, subtraction, and comparison of time durations. It provides 
an intuitive interface to work with durations, making it easier to handle tasks involving time calculations.

#Vector implementation

The Vector Library project involves creating a custom implementation of the vector data structure commonly used in 
programming. The library includes classes required for vector functionality, such as the Vector class itself, Iterator 
classes for traversing the vector, and utility functions for manipulation and querying. This library provides a flexible 
and efficient alternative to built-in vector containers.

#Double-Linked List

The Double-Linked List project showcases an implementation of the doubly-linked list data structure. The DoubleLinkedList 
class offers methods to insert, remove, and search for elements in the list. It provides a dynamic and efficient way to store 
and manage collections of data.

#Sentinel-Based Double-Linked List
The Sentinel-Based Double-Linked List project expands on the Double-Linked List project by incorporating a sentinel node. 
The sentinel node serves as a placeholder, simplifying the implementation and reducing edge cases for empty lists. 
The SentinelDoubleLinkedList class provides methods to manipulate the list efficiently.

#Stack and Queue Implementations

The Stack and Queue Implementations project demonstrates the implementation of the stack and queue data structures. 
The Stack class represents a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure, while the Queue class represents a first-in, 
first-out (FIFO) data structure. These classes offer methods for pushing, popping, and accessing elements, providing a 
foundation for various applications involving data storage and retrieval.

#Heap and Map Implementations

The Heap and Map Implementations project focuses on the implementation of the heap and map data structures. 
The Heap class provides methods for building and maintaining a binary heap, which allows efficient access to the maximum element. 
The Map class offers key-value storage and retrieval functionality, enabling efficient searching and manipulation of data based on keys.

This repository follows a structured organization. Each project has its own folder, containing the relevant source code files.
Feel free to navigate through the folders and explore the individual projects.

Thank you for your interest in the Data Structures Projects repository. I hope these projects provide valuable insights into the 
implementation and utilization of different data structures, and inspire further exploration in this area.
